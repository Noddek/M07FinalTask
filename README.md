Hello, Dmitry!

This is some information about the homework.

I tried to create an partial simulation of the store's operation for the homework.

Notes:
1. The folder/file hierarchy was important to me, so I still numbered some folder/file names using letters first and then numbers.
2. Below are written numbered tasks with the file name where you can find the example.

Basic level:

Task 1. Use of inheritance. - A2Laptop.cs
Task 2.1. Use of abstract classes. - A1Product.cs
Task 2.2. Use of abstract class members. - A1Product.cs
Task 3. Use of encapsulation principles. - Implemented in the code in general.
Task 4.1. Use of method overrides. - A1Product.cs
Task 4.2. Use of property overrides. - A1Customer.cs
Task 5. Use 4 own classes as a minimum. - Implemented.
Task 6. Use of class constructors with parameters. - Implemented.
Task 7. Use of generics. - A1Product.cs, C1GeneralStuff.cs
		I can't say that I was able to successfully use generics, because every time 
		there was a question in which cases it is reasonable to use them and in which 
		cases it's not, because there are some problems with the work of generics 
		when implementing logic in classes.
		Everything works without generics, that's why generics in the code are more 
		given as an example for homework (except for one small and simple generic in 
		the file C1GeneralStuff.cs, where it makes perfect sense).
Task 8. Use of properties. - Implemented.
Task 9. Use of class composition. - B1IndividualCustomer.cs

Advanced level:

Task 10.1. Use of static classes. - CommonEnums.cs
Task 10.2. Use of static elements. - A4ProductNomenclature.cs
Task 11. Use of generic methods. - C1GeneralStuff.cs
Task 12. Correct use of abstract classes (use them where system parameters
  require it). - I hope my use cases are correct.
Task 13. Correct use of class element modifiers (to keep important fields
 unavailable for full control from the outside, use of protected). - I 
  hope my use cases are correct.
Task 14. Use of properties with logic in get and/or set blocks. - B1IndividualCustomer.cs

Complicated level:

Task 15. Use of extension methods. - A2CustomerExtensions.cs
Task 16. The use of generic inheritance. - A2Laptop.cs
Task 17. Use of class aggregation. - B1ProductInStock.cs
Task 18. Use of indexers. - B2ProductsInStock.cs
Task 19. Use of overloaded operators. - B1ProductInStock.cs
